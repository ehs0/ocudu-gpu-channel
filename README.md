**GPU-accelerated, ZMQ-native channel emulator for live srsRAN and OCUDU stacks.**
Routes `cf32` IQ between radio endpoints and applies CUDA channel models
across multi-gNB, multi-UE and multi-antenna topologies. Processing targets
5G NR slot timing; deadline compliance depends on the workload.

See the [technical reference](https://zhouyou-gu.github.io/ocudu-gpu-channel/)
([local copy](docs/index.html)) for architecture, channel processing and
measured performance.

## Status

- **Available:** CUDA channel models, live Sionna RT matrix updates, a moving
  SUTD scene and one dashboard with independent metrics for each gNB.
- **Validated configurations:** single-UE, multi-UE and two-gNB setups, plus
  rank-1 MISO/SIMO with two or four gNB antenna ports and one port per UE.
  These results apply to the configurations and revisions in the linked reports.
- **Remaining limits:** continuous two-UE moving traffic and strict zero-miss
  real-time qualification still fail. Geometry changes can reset signal history.

See the [integration and validation guide](docs/sionna-integration.md) and
[rank-1 results](docs/rank1-feasibility-report.en.html) for evidence and limits.

srsRAN's ZMQ driver transports IQ; this emulator adds channel impairments
between the radio endpoints.

## What's inside

- **Implementation:** C++20, CUDA, CMake and libzmq.
- **`ocudu-gpu-channel`** — the broker CLI; sits between two ZMQ endpoints and
  serves processed IQ at slot cadence.
- **`ocudu-gpu-channel-bench`** — per-topology latency benchmark (H2D / kernel /
  D2H, CPU stage timings).
- **`ocudu-zmq-source` / `ocudu-zmq-sink`** — synthetic IQ tools for
  hardware-free validation.
- **CUDA backend** — applies each incoming channel and combines its signal
  into the receiver output.
- **CPU reference backend** — same step set, used by tests and local development.
- **Sionna RT bridge and Web UI** — live matrix updates, moving scene and ray
  views, channel/resource plots, and independent scheduler metrics for each gNB.
- Example topologies in [`examples/`](examples/): single-edge MVP, 3-node
  interference + crosstalk graph, 2-cell / 4-node multi-gNB, multi-UE OCUDU
  Docker, 16-edge stress, and TR 38.901 §7.7.2 TDL-A through TDL-E profiles.

**Channel models:** TDL-A through TDL-E, path loss, phase, CFO and AWGN,
including multipath with integer/fractional delays, Jakes fading and Rician LOS.
Matrix channels support fixed coefficients, independent fading lanes and spatial
correlation. CPU/CUDA comparisons use each test's stated numerical tolerance.
Full statistical CDL remains [planned](docs/index.html#scope).

**Live matrix updates:** identical and gain/phase-only updates preserve signal
history. Delay/layout changes reset history and start warmup. Control delays
are limited to **1023 samples**; dynamic CUDA matrices require the device-channel
route. Geometry changes are not seamless.

**Radio limits:** live srsUE validation is rank-1 MISO/SIMO. Its single antenna
port does not establish rank-2 operation or same-PRB MU-MIMO. The tested live
downlink uses one radiating gNB branch; see the
[multi-port reference](docs/index.html#part-vii) for the matrix model and evidence.

## Quick start — local synthetic loop

Open four terminals: two synthetic IQ sources, the broker, two paced sinks.

```sh
# Terminal 1: source for TX endpoint 1
./build/ocudu-zmq-source --endpoint tcp://*:2000 --duration 20s

# Terminal 2: source for TX endpoint 2
./build/ocudu-zmq-source --endpoint tcp://*:2101 --duration 20s

# Terminal 3: broker — applies the channel per slot (CPU backend in this local example)
./build/ocudu-gpu-channel --config examples/topology.local.cpu.yaml --duration 20s

# Terminal 4: paced sinks (one request per 1 ms at 23.04 MS/s)
./build/ocudu-zmq-sink --endpoint tcp://127.0.0.1:2001 --duration 10s --request-interval-us 1000
./build/ocudu-zmq-sink --endpoint tcp://127.0.0.1:2100 --duration 10s --request-interval-us 1000
```

`--request-interval-us 1000` is the strict-realtime pace. Drop it for a free-running test.

## Build

Ubuntu 22.04+:

```sh
sudo apt-get install -y cmake g++ pkg-config libzmq3-dev
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j"$(nproc)"
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

macOS (Homebrew):

```sh
brew install cmake zeromq pkg-config
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

The **CUDA backend builds automatically when `nvcc` is on PATH** at configure
time. Without CUDA, only the CPU backend is built and a `backend: cuda` config
is rejected at load.

## Run in Docker

The repo ships a multi-stage [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) that builds the broker
and bakes in the example topologies. Requires the
[NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)
on the host for `--gpus all`.

```sh
# Build the GPU image (multi-arch by default: Ampere -> Blackwell + PTX).
docker build -t ocudu-gpu-channel:latest .

# Run the broker on a baked-in example (Linux host networking).
docker run --rm --gpus all --network host ocudu-gpu-channel:latest \
  --config /opt/ocudu/examples/topology.mvp.cuda.yaml --duration 15s
```

Tune for your hardware and host:

```sh
# Faster build for one known GPU (e.g. H100 = sm_90):
docker build --build-arg CUDA_ARCH=90-real -t ocudu-gpu-channel:h100 .

# CPU-only image — no NVIDIA GPU, CI, Mac, or AMD:
docker build \
  --build-arg ENABLE_CUDA=OFF \
  --build-arg DEVEL_BASE=ubuntu:24.04 \
  --build-arg RUNTIME_BASE=ubuntu:24.04 \
  -t ocudu-gpu-channel:cpu .
```

`CUDA_VER` (default `12.8.1`) selects the CUDA base image — lower it to match
an older host driver, dropping `120-real` from `CUDA_ARCH` since Blackwell
needs CUDA ≥ 12.8. The container runs as a non-root `ocudu` user.

On non-host networking (Docker Desktop), publish the control plane instead:
`-p 5559:5559 -p 5560:5560` plus your per-node data endpoints. For real-time
runs, prefer `--cpuset-cpus` pinning over a `--cpus` quota (a CFS quota can
inject scheduling stalls). The deeper [technical reference
§21.2](docs/index.html#container) covers the run contract in full.

## Benchmark

```sh
# CPU reference (any platform)
./build/ocudu-gpu-channel-bench --config examples/topology.local.cpu.yaml --duration 10s --scs-khz 30

# CUDA backend (adds per-stage GPU timings)
./build/ocudu-gpu-channel-bench --config examples/topology.mvp.cuda.yaml --duration 10s --scs-khz 30
```

CUDA output emits `model_mix_latency` plus `h2d_us`, `kernel_us`, `d2h_us`,
`gpu_process_us`. The per-slot gate (green / yellow / red), the methodology,
and the measured fan-in scaling live in
[technical reference §20](docs/index.html#perf).

Strict-realtime validation (fails the process on any flow / starvation /
continuity error):

```sh
./build/ocudu-gpu-channel --config examples/topology.mvp.cuda.yaml --duration 20s --strict-realtime
```

## Remote RTX workstation

Validation has three layers: CTest unit tests, the nine-stage synthetic GPU
suite, and live-radio integration tests with real gNB, srsUE and core processes.
The GPU toolchain can be installed in user space:

```sh
./scripts/remote/bootstrap-user-tools.sh        # CMake + CUDA 12.8.1 + ZeroMQ under ~/ocudu-gpu-channel-workspace/tools/
./scripts/remote/probe.sh                       # sanity-check the toolchain
./scripts/remote/build-and-bench-cuda-mvp.sh    # rsync, build, run the CUDA MVP benchmark
./scripts/remote/gpu-test-sequence.sh           # 9 stages: build, CTest, clean/AWGN, interference, multi-gNB, TDL-A, correlated MIMO, live correlation control
```

`gpu-test-sequence.sh` must pass before broker or CUDA backend changes ship.
Recorded RTX 5090 results are tied to their tested revisions:

- **Latest launcher/dashboard checks (`e59e095`):** 90 Python tests and both
  frontend regressions passed; see the [merge report](docs/main-merge-validation.md).
- **Earlier channel checks (`16af288`):** CTest 12/12, all nine GPU stages and
  Compute Sanitizer checks passed; see the
  [channel validation report](docs/sionna-merge-fixes-validation.md).
- **Separate UE recovery (`daa167ae3`):** 18 focused tests passed; an existing
  full NR RRC fixture failure remains documented in the
  [UE validation summary](docs/sionna-integration.md#ue-recovery-validation).

These checks do not establish continuous moving connectivity or zero-miss
real-time operation.

## OCUDU + srsRAN interop

Full OCUDU Docker gNB ↔ broker ↔ srsUE runbook with attach + ping verification:
[**docs/ocudu-interop.md**](docs/ocudu-interop.md).

The default UE repository is
[`zhouyou-gu/srsRAN_4G`](https://github.com/zhouyou-gu/srsRAN_4G). The latest
recovery validation used commit `daa167ae3443b046ce560df646c7dc5f17e5c1dd`
on `fix/sa-ra-recovery-5090`, version `25.10.0`. These local fixes are not
claimed to be on remote `master`. The [integration guide](docs/sionna-integration.md#ue-recovery-validation)
records the exact build, real two-gNB/two-UE results and remaining limits.

End-to-end-validated topologies:

- Single-cell, single-UE: [`examples/topology.ocudu-docker.cuda.yaml`](examples/topology.ocudu-docker.cuda.yaml)
- Multi-UE, one cell, realistic per-UE channel: [`examples/topology.ocudu-docker.multi-ue.cuda.yaml`](examples/topology.ocudu-docker.multi-ue.cuda.yaml)
- 3-node interference + crosstalk graph: [`examples/topology.graph.cuda.yaml`](examples/topology.graph.cuda.yaml)
- 2-cell / 4-node / 8-edge multi-gNB: [`examples/topology.multi-gnb.cuda.yaml`](examples/topology.multi-gnb.cuda.yaml)

Synthetic-loop validation matches the analytic superposition to < 0.3 % on real
GPU runs, with all broker data-integrity counters at zero.
